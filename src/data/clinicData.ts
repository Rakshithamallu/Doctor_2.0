Today he is walking properly, driving a car, and has resumed his routine activities comfortably. Initially we had consulted another hospital where knee replacement was advised immediately. However, upon careful evaluation Dr. Shashi suggested and performed Right Arthroscopic Medial Meniscal Repair with Intra-Articular PRP Infiltration, which proved to be the most appropriate treatment. Honest opinion, precise diagnosis, and conservative approach helped avoid unnecessary major surgery."

    category: "Robotic Surgery",
    question: "What are the key benefits of Robotic Knee Replacement over traditional surgery?",
    answer: "Robotic knee replacement uses CT-guided or real-time 3D optical tracking to create a personalized surgical plan tailored to your exact anatomy. Key benefits include sub-millimeter precision implant placement, preservation of healthy bone and ligaments, significantly less blood loss and post-operative pain, and faster recovery—most patients walk within hours of surgery."
  },
  {
    id: "faq-3",
    category: "Arthroscopy",
    question: "What is Keyhole Arthroscopy and how long is the hospital stay?",
    answer: "Arthroscopy is a minimally invasive procedure where a small 4mm camera (arthroscope) and specialized micro-instruments are inserted through tiny keyhole punctures. It allows Dr. Shashi to repair torn ligaments (ACL/PCL), meniscus tears, or rotator cuff tendons without cutting open large muscles. Most arthroscopy patients go home either the same day or within 24 hours."

    id: "faq-4",
    category: "Conservative Spine",
    question: "Can back pain and sciatica be treated without undergoing spine surgery?",
    answer: "Yes! Over 90% of back pain and sciatica cases can be successfully resolved without open spine surgery. We prioritize structured conservative treatments including targeted spinal anti-inflammatory medications, physical core stabilization, ergonomic posture retraining, and image-guided epidural nerve root injections for instant relief."

    category: "Insurance & Payment",
    question: "Is cashless health insurance and TPA accepted for surgeries?",
    answer: "Yes, cashless hospitalization and insurance claims are supported across all major health insurance companies, corporate TPAs, and government health schemes through our accredited hospital surgical partner facilities in Mysuru."
  },
  {
    id: "faq-6",
    category: "Regenerative PRP",
    question: "How does Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy work for knee arthritis?",
    answer: "PRP is an autologous biologic therapy where a small sample of your own blood is centrifuged to concentrate healing platelets and growth factors. When injected into an arthritic joint or damaged tendon, PRP reduces chronic inflammation, lubricates the joint, and stimulates cellular repair, offering prolonged pain relief without foreign chemicals or steroids."
